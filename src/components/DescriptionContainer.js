            <ol>
                <li><i>Mini Games:</i> 2 teams (3v3 or 4v4) compete in mini games to win gold medals. The first team to win 7 gold medals wins the game.</li>
                <li><i>Guess Cards:</i> If a player lands on a guess card the player will guess the card about everyone in the room with a yes or no response. If the player guesses correctly the responder drinks if the player guesses incorrectly the player drinks.</li>
                <li><i>Mystery Cards:</i> If a player lands on a mystery card then the player does as the card says or says ‘pass’ and drinks instead.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>3 materials required to start</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The game board (make one in less than 3 mins see “How to make the board?” below)</li>
                <li>2 game pieces (e.g a dime &amp; a pennie) &amp; a game die (optional if you use your phone)</li>
                <li>A smart phone or computer with internet access</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
                <p><i>Read on for more info on the game or making the board...</i></p>
            </div>

                <h3>Other rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each team places their game piece on Thunder-Struck and begins the game by playing Thunderstruck (first team to have a player to finish their drink goes first) or rolling the die (team with the highest number goes first).</li>
                    <li>Each team alternates turns rolling a die to move their team's game piece counter clockwise around the board. Players on the same team should take turns rolling the die when it’s their team's turn to roll.</li>
                    <li>Everytime your team’s piece passes 12 or 6 O'clock on the board everyone on your team takes a shot.</li>
                    <li>Everytime your team’s piece passes, Thunder-struck automatically wins a gold medal for your team.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Don’t have a game board? No problem making one in about 3 mins.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a piece of paper and pen and draw one large circle with a smaller circle inside.</li>
                    <li>Draw two lines to split the board into four quadrants.</li>
                    <li>In each quadrant, draw 7 lines to create 8 spots for a total of 32 spots on the board.</li>
                    <li>Start with the game spot directly to the right at 12 O'clock moving counterclockwise following the pattern “G” “M” “G” “?” with one symbol in each spot.</li>
                    <li>On the board’s 12 &amp; 6 O'clock line write the word “Team Shot”.</li>
                    <li>On the spot directly to the left at 12 O'clock write “Thunder-start”.</li>
                    <li>That’s it! You’ve made a game board of your own!</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>How do you play Thunderstruck?</h3>
                    <p>You give all the players a drink, have them stand in a circle and start listening to AC/DC's Thunderstruck. The first time you hear 'Thunder', the first person starts drinking. The next time you hear 'thunder,' the person drinking stops, and the person to their left begins.</p>
                <h3>Purpose of the game?</h3>
                    <p>The olympic cup is nothing more than an opportunity to get to know others better through a shared experience.</p>
                <h3>How do you win?</h3>
                    <p>The first team to win 7 gold medals wins. Gold medals can be won in mini games or when your team’s piece passes Thunder-Start.</p>
                <h3>Who’s the game for?</h3>
                    <p>The Olympic Cup is for those who love mini games, questions, and learning about others.</p>
                <h3>When should the game be played?</h3>
                    <p>The olympic cup was designed to be played the second half of an hour and half pregame, but it can be played whenever you want!</p>
                <h3>How long should the Olympic Cup take?</h3>
                    <p>The game was designed to take an average of 45 minutes. Once you know how to play the mini games should take on average 2 minutes and the guess and mystery cards 1 minute. </p>
